        <img src="a.jpg" class = "answer"><p2>At our firm, we offer various fee structures depending on the nature of the case. We may work on a contingency basis, where the fee is a percentage of the final settlement or verdict. Alternatively, we may charge an hourly rate or provide a fixed fee arrangement. During your initial consultation, we will discuss the fee structure that best suits your case and provide transparent information about costs.</p2><br><br>
        <img src="Q.jpeg" class = "question"><h3>What is the legal process like?</h3><br><br>
        <img src="a.jpg" class = "answer"><p2>The legal process can vary depending on the type of case and jurisdiction. Generally, it involves several stages, including investigation, filing legal documents, discovery, negotiations, and, if necessary, trial. As your attorney, I will guide you through each step, ensuring you understand the process and your rights at every stage. Rest assured, I will work diligently to achieve the best possible outcome for your case.</p2><br><br>
        <img src="Q.jpeg" class = "question"><h3>How long will my case take to resolve?</h3><br><br>
        <img src="a.jpg" class = "answer"><p2>The duration of a case depends on several factors, such as the complexity of the legal issues involved, the cooperation of all parties, and court availability. Some cases can be resolved relatively quickly through negotiations or settlements, while others may require more time for thorough investigation and litigation. During our initial consultation, I will assess the specifics of your case and provide an estimate of the anticipated timeline.</p2><br><br>
        <img src="Q.jpeg" class = "question"><h3>Will my information be kept confidential?</h3><br><br>
        <img src="a.jpg" class = "answer"><p2>Yes, absolutely. Client confidentiality is of utmost importance to us. As an attorney, I am bound by professional ethics and legal obligations to maintain the confidentiality of all client information. Rest assured that any information shared with us will be treated with the strictest confidentiality and will only be used for the purpose of your legal representation.</p2><br><br>
